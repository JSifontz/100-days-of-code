# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I read a lot about making unit testing with Vue and reading Vue documentation to remember how it works while I was working on tic-tac-toe game.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with Vue unit testing (with Jest) to try to implement it but I decide to let it for a more complex app. Besides the documentation that I read was a little bit old.

**Link to work:** [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/100DaysOfVue/tic-tac-toe/commit/5da4662a18a405a543d044eee565ddcc4476a3b8)

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
