# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I read a lot about making unit testing with Vue and reading Vue documentation to remember how it works while I was working on tic-tac-toe game.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with Vue unit testing (with Jest) to try to implement it but I decide to let it for a more complex app. Besides the documentation that I read was a little bit old.

### Day 2: November 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add the component functionality to change props from a child component to his parent.

**Thoughts**: Was a great fight figure out how to implement this functionality because I was trying to change the array of the vue data assigning it directly a value with his index `arr[i]="x"` and for that vuejs have [certain methods to detect the change of an array with v-for directive](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/list.html#Array-Change-Detection). BTW I was conscious that if want change some properties through the child component I have to use the method $emit but the methods mentioned above took me sorpresibly.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
